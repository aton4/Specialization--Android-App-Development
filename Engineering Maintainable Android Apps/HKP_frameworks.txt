Frameworks that I think should be used for the HKP app are HaMeR and Expresso. The HKP app would most likely have downloads such as a pdf file of all employees; a thread should take in a handler reference and handle a download concurrently after finishing the thread would use the handler reference to send a message back to the main activity indicating that the download has finished.
Expresso is also essential to the HKP app to automate integration testing, automatic testing would speed up development by reducing the time required to test all parts of the app after a new feature has been added. This will also reduce the laziness of testing and the fear of adding new features that might randomly break the code, automated testing would immediately point out problems when new features are added.
